core/state.py — LangGraph Shared State Schema

The relay baton passed between all agents.
Every agent reads from this, writes to this, and returns the updated version.

New field: `routing_plan`
  The Planner now outputs not just sub_queries but also WHICH TOOLS to use
  for each sub-query. This is the triage nurse's chart.
